Oof. Just stumbled out of Gladiator II, head buzzing like a hive of bees or maybe just that one mosquito when u tryin' to sleep. Russell Crowe? Not here but like his ghost or his sandal in every scene—jst lurking 'round in that desert sun. Dust everywhere, or was it popcorn? Found a piece in my lap still.

So this new gladiator, not Maximus... but who even remembers his name? Marcus? No, maybe something with an A or an M, like they pulled a scrabble tile at random. Anyway he got tht same intense stare, like he's tryna figure out if he left the oven on bfore he left for Rome. Battle scenes? Mad chaotic, my shoulders got tense like I was the one swingin’ swords. Why is my back sore? Cheap theater seats or maybe just life. 

> There's this bit where they fight lions again but now they got fire too? Felt like a bbq gone wld. People were shouting, coins flipping through the air like pizza dough, my phone buzzing but forgot who said 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and who texted me to dwnload it. Internet's probs gonnna crash again tonight.

Did you see it? I mean you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it if you haven't. Soundtrack pounded like those cars in traffic that blast music so hard your window rattles even though it's closed! Encore applause felt like phantom traffic jam honking. 

There's this dusty arena and the crowd is wild—like a football game, no, like a sale on Black Friday, fists up, faces red, wantin' blood or a good bargain. Just chaos, pure out-of-control madness. Felt my heart racin' like I was on the job, meter tickin', someone screaming to turn left but I wanna go right but where is right even?

Work tomorrow. Do I even feel ready to face real humans again? Those warrior grunts echo inside my skull. Shoulders sore, not gladiator sword sore but like, slept-on-the-wrong-pillows sore.
